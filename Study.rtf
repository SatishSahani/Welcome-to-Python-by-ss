\cf0 1. Question: What is a data structure?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory in a manner that allows efficient access, modification, and processing of that data. It provides a way to represent relationships between different pieces of information.\par
\par
\cf0 2. Question: What is the difference between an array and a linked list?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: An array is a contiguous block of memory that stores elements of the same type, accessed using indices. A linked list is a collection of nodes, each containing data and a reference (or link) to the next node. Arrays offer fast random access, while linked lists allow efficient insertions and deletions.\par
\par
\cf0 3. Question: Explain the concept of time complexity in algorithms.\par
\cf1\par
Answer: Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It provides an estimate of how the algorithm's performance scales with larger inputs. Common notations include O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), etc.\par
\cf0\par
4. Question: What is a stack?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack. Common operations are push (add an element) and pop (remove the top element).\par
\par
\cf0 5. Question: Describe the concept of recursion.\par
\cf1\par
Answer: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of a problem. Each recursive call brings the problem closer to a base case where a direct solution is known. It's commonly used in problems with a divide-and-conquer approach.\par
\par
\cf0 6. Question: What is a binary search tree (BST)?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A binary search tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. In a BST, for each node, all nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.\par
\par
\cf0 7. Question: How does a hash table work?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array. It allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of values associated with keys. Hash collisions, when two keys map to the same index, are handled using collision resolution techniques.\par
\par
\cf0 8. Question: Explain Dijkstra's algorithm.\par
\cf1\par
Answer: Dijkstra's algorithm is a shortest-path algorithm that finds the shortest distance between a starting node and all other nodes in a weighted graph. It maintains a set of nodes with known shortest distances and gradually expands this set while updating distances based on the weights of edges.\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
\cf0 9. Question: What is a queue?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. Common operations are enqueue (add an element) and dequeue (remove the front element).\par
\par
\cf0 10. Question: Explain the concept of a linked list cycle.\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A linked list cycle occurs when a node in a linked list points to a previous node, creating a loop. Detecting cycles in linked lists is commonly done using Floyd's cycle detection algorithm, also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm.\par
\par
\cf0 11. Question: What is a priority queue?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A priority queue is an abstract data type that maintains a set of elements, each associated with a priority. It allows insertion of elementswith priorities and removal of the element with the highest (or lowest) priority efficiently.\par
\par
\cf0 12. Question: Describe the quicksort algorithm.\par
\cf1\par
Answer: Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It selects a "pivot" element and rearranges the other elements in the array such that elements smaller than the pivot are placed before it, and elements greater than the pivot are placed after it. This process is recursively applied to sub-arrays.\par
\par
\cf0 13. Question: Explain dynamic programming.\par
\par
\cf1 Answer: Dynamic programming is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to avoid redundant calculations. It's often used to solve optimization problems.\par
\par
\cf0 14. Question: What is a graph?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can be directed (edges have a direction) or undirected, and they are used to model relationships and connections between entities.\par
\par
\cf0 15. Question: Describe the concept of a hash function.\par
\par
\cf1 Answer: A hash function is a mathematical function that converts an input (such as a key) into an output (a hash value). Hash functions are used in hash tables for efficient storage and retrieval of data based on keys.\par
\par
\cf0 16. Question: What is breadth-first search (BFS)?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: Breadth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level. It's often used to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\par
\par
\cf0 17. Question: Explain the concept of memoization.\par
\cf1\par
Answer: Memoization is a technique used in dynamic programming to optimize recursive algorithms by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.\par
\par
\cf0 18. Question: What is a heap?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A heap is a specialized binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max-heap, the parent node's value is greater than or equal to the values of its children. In a min-heap, the parent node's value is smaller than or equal to the values of its children.\par
\par
\cf0 19. Question: Describe the merge sort algorithm.\cf1\par
\par
Answer: Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. It follows the divide-and-conquer approach.\par
\par
\cf0 20. Question: What is a trie?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings. Each node in the trie represents a common prefix of a group of strings, making it efficient for string-related operations like prefix search.\par
\par
\cf0 21. Question: Explain the concept of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A directed acyclic graph is a graph that has no cycles (closed paths), meaning you can't start at a node and follow edges to return to the same node without repeating any edges. DAGs are commonly used to represent dependencies and relationships without circular dependencies.\par
\cf0\par
22. Question: What is the Knapsack problem?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: The Knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem where you are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity. The goal is to determine the most valuable combination of items to include in the knapsack without exceeding its capacity.\par
\par
\cf0 23. Question: Explain the concept of binary search.\par
\cf1\par
Answer: Binary search is an efficient search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the search range in half until the target is found or the search range is empty.\par
\par
\cf0 24. Question: What is the difference between a stack and a queue?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, while a queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the top, while in a queue, elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.\par
\par
\cf0 25. Question: Explain the concept of an AVL tree.\par
\cf1\par
Answer: An AVL tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. It ensures that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node (balance factor) is at most one, maintaining efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.\par
\par
\cf0 26. Question: What is a spanning tree?\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph while forming a tree structure (no cycles). Spanning trees are often used to represent the minimum connected subset of edges in a graph.\par
\par
\cf0 27. Question: Describe the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.\par
\cf1\par
Answer: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph, including both positive and negative edge weights. It uses dynamic programming and updates the shortest paths iteratively.\par
\par
\cf0 28. Question: Explain the concept of in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal in binary trees.\par
\cf1\par
Answer: These are methods of traversing a binary tree:\par
\par
In-order: Visit the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.\par
Pre-order: Visit the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.\par
Post-order: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.\par
\cf0 29. Question: What is a Trie?\cf1\par
\par
Answer: A Trie (pronounced as "try") is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings. It's particularly efficient for searching for words with a common prefix and is often used for implementing dictionary-like structures, auto-suggestions, and more.\par
\par
\cf0 30. Question: Explain the concept of a Red-Black Tree.\par
\cf1\par
Answer: A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balanced properties by assigning one of two colors, red or black, to each node. These properties ensure that the tree remains balanced and operations like insertion, deletion, and search have logarithmic complexity.\par
